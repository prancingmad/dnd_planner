# DnD Planner

A **Python 3 Tkinter-based application** for managing and planning **Dungeons & Dragons campaigns**.  

Manage your party, NPCs, bestiary, regions, and generate loot or encounters. The program dynamically adapts as more data is entered and stores all information in JSON files.

## Features

### Party Management
- Input and manage player data.  
- Automatically calculates **estimated party strength**.  
- Keep track of party members and their stats.

### Bestiary
- Input and manage enemy/monster data.  
- Generate **balanced encounters** based on party strength.  
- Stores all enemies in JSON for future reference.

### Loot Generators
- Generate treasure and loot for encounters or campaigns.  
- Loot tables can be customized and extended.

### Region Management
- Input and manage location and region data.  
- Build interconnected locations with NPCs and encounters.  
- Program updates JSON data dynamically as regions are expanded.

### Data Persistence
- All information is stored in JSON files under the `jsons/` folder.  
- Program adapts as data is added, making it easy to continue campaigns over multiple sessions.
